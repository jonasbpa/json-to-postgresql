# json-to-postgresql
A simple application that imports JSON collections into PostgreSQL.

Currently, it only supports locally saved .json files, and it's using express requests to manage these imports.

# Planned
Currently planned:
- Bigint support
- Console support
- Different configs (for indexing, specifying types and others)
